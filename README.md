# Venice Swap Token Generation Event (TGE)

Venice Swap: Venice Swap owes its name to the extraordinary history of the Most Serene Republic of Venice as a naval and mercantile empire, which between Rialto and Piazza San Marco invented the very concept of a modern stock exchange. Just as the Serenissima did in the past, today Venice Swap intends to shape a new concept of crypto exchange where a bunch of different applications will create a powerful shared one-stop crypto experience for end users and traders. The first phase of Venice Swap project will be our Initial Coin Offering of <i>VENICE COIN (“VENICE”)</i>, the utility token that Venice Swap Platform will use in all transactions related to distributed credits on the Platform itself. Our roadmap foresees then the launch of Venice Swap Crypto Exchange in next Q1-2022 (predictably in the month of February) and then the completion of the first set of provided crypto tools with the publishing of our DeFi Swap application..<br>
